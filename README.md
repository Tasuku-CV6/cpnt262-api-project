# CPNT-262-A Weather Dashboard Mini Project

## Author: Ethan Dam

## Assignemnt Infomration:

In this Weather Dashboard Mini Project I will create a Weather Dashboard web app that fetches live weather data for a city using an API. I will also add personalization features using cookies, local storage, and session storage to make the app more user-friendly.

## Pseudocode:

1. Create variables to store:

- The weather form
- The city input field
- The name input field
- The card element where weather data will be displayed
- The toggle button to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- The API key for the weather API
- The unit of temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit)

2. When the toggle button is clicked:

- If it's checked, set the temperature unit to Fahrenheit
- If it's not checked, set the temperature unit to Celsius
- If the city input is not empty, fetch the weather data again

3.

// TODO:
// 1. Local Storage name and city repopulates page only when saved and not when you first enter the website. (Kinda did it)
// 2. Add somekind of text input where entering the user's name will personalize the greeting. (Kinda did it just need to hide it when clicking the button again)
// 3. Apply some CSS styling to the page, such as adding a weather themed background Image. (Added background Image but still need to fix some things)
// 4. Maybe add a "remember perferences" button where it loads saved user information such as name and city (Not gonna do it)

// Misc

// Add some Variables only into the functions where is it needed, and not leaving them as gobal if it is not going ot be used anywhere else
